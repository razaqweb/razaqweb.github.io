# razaqweb.github.io

This is my personal portfolio website. The older version is in the 'main' branch as a backup. This version uses far less code and has a much more friendly UI design, especially when it comes to displaying projects.

It will be regularly updated with new projects and any new languages and skills I learn will be updated in my about section.
